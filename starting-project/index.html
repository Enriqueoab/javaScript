    <!-- WHY IS THE ALERT SCRIPT FIRING-UP BEFORE RENDER THE HTML?

    You just can't control with JavaScript how/when the browser renders the page content
    (this happens in a different thread). The important point is that you will always get
    the correct current values if you display them in an alert (e.g. for debugging purposes).
    These are always calculated before the alert is opened and the browser "freezes".
    But if you want to take control of the rendering process, you will have to implement
    your own modal (which would be common practice anyway since it looks much nicer,
    see section 7 of this course). -->
